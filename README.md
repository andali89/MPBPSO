# MPBPSO Implementation

This is an implementation of a multi-objective optimization method called 
MPBPSO for key quality feature selection (feature selection) in complex manufacturing processes. The optimization algrithm is a multi-objective probability-based PSO algorithm. For a detailed description of the method please refer to
